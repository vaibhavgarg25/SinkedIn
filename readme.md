# SinkedIn

SinkedIn is a platform for celebrating failures. It’s like LinkedIn, but instead of boasting about success stories and achievements, SinkedIn is all about sharing your epic fails. Missed deadlines, terrible pitches, or other mishaps? SinkedIn is the place to showcase your raw, glorious disasters—no achievements allowed!

## Why SinkedIn?

The world is full of success stories, but what about the lessons learned from failure? SinkedIn was created to:

- **Celebrate Failure:** Share your mishaps and laugh together.
- **Learn Together:** Discover the valuable lessons hidden in each failure.
- **Stay Authentic:** A space free from “#humblebrags” and disguised wins.

## Key Features

- **Failure Stories Only:** An AI-powered content filter ensures only authentic failure stories are allowed. Any “I failed but turned it into a million-dollar empire” posts? Rejected.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for sharing your stories.
- **Built for Fun:** Designed during a 24-hour IEDC hackathon to embrace the lighter side of life.
